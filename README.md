# ⚛️ React Typescript Rollup Starter

Bare bones [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) template for building [React](https://reactjs.org) + [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) ES Modules.

## ❓ What can I use it for?

To develop React Typescript components that are bundled as ES Modules.

## ⚙️ Getting started

This repository is a GitHub template. Click on "Use this template" above to the right to create a new repository with the same directory structure and files.

Or you can clone it locally by using

```
git clone https://github.com/a11y-gigachad-org/gigachad-react-rollup-starter.git my-app
```

## 📖 Usage

`npm run build` bundles files into `dist/index.js` and types into `dist/types/index.d.js`.

`npm start` builds and watches the files during development.

`npm link` in the module directory and then `npm link <packgage.name>` in any [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) or [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org) repository to develop your components for the browser.

`npm test` runs [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
